Some lights look like moving curtains. Others look like a steady glow, or bands across the sky. The lights are usually green, but you may see other colors, like yellow, red, purple, or blue. The lights are dazzling as they dance far above your head.\n",

They can enter the atmosphere near the North Pole. These particles interact with the gases in our atmosphere. This causes the beautiful lights we see in the sky.\n",
